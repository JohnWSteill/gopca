GO-PCA
======

GO-PCA is an unsupervised method to explore gene expression data using prior knowledge. It combines `principal component analysis (PCA) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis>`_ with `nonparametric GO enrichment analysis <http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-10-48>`_, in order to generate *signatures*, i.e., small sets of genes that are both strongly correlated and closely functionally related. It then produces a *signature matrix*, which contains the expression profiles of all signatures across all samples, based on the untransformed data.
