# GO-PCA

An unsupervised Method to Explore Biological Heterogeneity Based on Gene Expression and Prior Knowledge.

# Requirements

GO-PCA was developed under Linux using Python 2.7. It requires:
* Python 2.7
* Third-party Python packages: NumPy, scikit-learn (which in turn requires SciPy), Cython
* My own Python packages [GOParser](https://github.com/flo-compbio/goparser) v1.0, and [XL-mHG](https://github.com/flo-compbio/xlmhg) v1.0 (both already included in this distribution)
* Approx. 1 GB of memory 

I highly recommend using GO-PCA in combination with the IPython notebook, which is now called "jupyter" (the IPython project is currently [undergoing some changes](https://blog.jupyter.org/2015/04/15/the-big-split/ "The Big Split")).

# How to Cite GO-PCA

If you use GO-PCA in your research, please cite [Wagner (2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/018705).

# Feedback

Please email me with bug reports, questions, comments, and suggestions: florian (dot) wagner (at) duke (dot) edu.

# Documentation

I plan to continuously improve the documentation of this method. Please let me know if you have ideas or requests that would make GO-PCA easier to install and use.
